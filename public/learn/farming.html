        <h4 style="text-align: center;">You will know why dairy farming is a good business, and what to look out for when you are starting out, because I am going to share some of my experiences for three+ years.</h4>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Why Start A Dairy Farm</b> </h2>
        <span style="text-align: center;">Now, the simplest answer for many can be, “dairy farming is profitable”.</span><br>
        <span style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Well, I’ll ask that question to you, “is dairy farming in a profitable business in Pakistan?”<br><br>

            Yours truly worked on a dairy farming project starting in June 2009. My interest was pretty much ‘academic’ at first; just knowing how the business and the animals operate. It was after almost a year of travelling in and around Punjab, meeting countless number of people in the field, discussing and debating with some very qualified dairy farming consultants and breeders, that I decided to dip my toes in this project.</span> <br><br><br>

            <p>
                <b> 1. Dairy Farming Business Model:</b> Dairy farming has a very unique business model, and no other business has the capability of multiplying its assets while still producing revenue. Remarkable. <br>

                <b>2.The Current Situation:</b> One of many lessons that Richard Branson has taught me is that you should get into a business where you think you can do better. Dairy farming, I knew, had a very, very large room for improvement (it still does!). <br>

               <b>3. A Very Solid Demand:</b> A lot of businesses and entrepreneurs would consider a ‘demand’ for something a good enough reason to get into any project. But for me, dairy farming is not only the demand of the market, but also a need. People need healthy, quality milk (and meat). It fits in with the idea of for-profit philanthropy where I stand a chance of actually helping people out, and earning prayers as well as profits. Now that’s an inspiration!
               <br>
               <b>4. Super Integration:</b>  This was not vertical integration as much as it was super integration. I already have two independent projects, one agriculture farming and the other is milk supply within Lahore, Alhumdulillah. The dairy farm has the potential of sitting in very nicely between the two, and providing wholesome integration. Although integration of any two businesses, much less three, is a pain in the neck (amongst other body parts), dairy farming provides me with the perfect long-term inspiration for working on these three projects!</p>
